# Tidy Data Project:Smartphone Motion Sensor Data Analysis
## Data Dictionary of the output file **tidySummaryData.txt** produced by **run_analysis.R**

This R script takes the raw input data with 561 variables and tidies it up by adding meaningful column headings,  removing brackets / commas from the column headings, replacing the activity identifier numbers with actual activity descriptions (e.g. WALKING, STANDING, etc.). 

Then R script extracts only those 66 variables out of the original 561, which are "mean" and "standard deviation" measurements. This gives a data frame of 10299 observations with those 66 variables for the combined Testing and Traing data.

Then the R script aggregates the data by subject and activity, thus giving 180 rows (30 volunteer subjects , multiplied by 6 activites). The aggregation operation applied is mean(i.e. simple arithmetic averaging).

Column #1. SubjectID

      + definition: Identifier within a group of 30 volunteer subjects whose motion data was recorded while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors (accelerometer and gyroscope).            
      + value:
          + 1...30
          
          
*** 

Column #2. activityName

      + definition: Each person in subject group performed six activities. This variable shows for each observation in the dataset which activity for each subject the other 66 variables were for.
      + value:
          + 1     WALKING
          + 2     WALKING_UPSTAIRS
          + 3     WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
          + 4     SITTING
          + 5     STANDING
          + 6     LAYING

Columns #3 to #68. The **average** of each of the 66 mean & std-variance variables for each activity and each subjectIDlues (excluding meanFreq).

+  Value:  the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. The values of the original variables themselves had already been normalised in the input data to be between -1 and 1. So the values of the averages of those variables also will be within the range -1 and 1.
