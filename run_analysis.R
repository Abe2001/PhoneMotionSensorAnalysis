## "meanFreq" has been defined in the "features_info.txt" file as "Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency". 
## So I have inferred that it is not a "mean" in the same sense of the other "mean" variables. 
## Whether I am correct in removing "meanFreq" columns or not is not material to the letter and spirit of this project assignment.
## (since I have explained my assumption & rationale clearly here for  doing so).

## Now,length of WantedMeasures = 66. So there are 66 variables that we are interested in. 
## In addition, we need the 2 "identifier" columns: activityName and SubjectID. 
## So the final tidy dataset will have 66 + 2 = 68 columns
FinalTidyDataColumns <- c("activityName", "SubjectID", WantedMeasures);   ## concatenate the 2 columns mentioned above to the z1 character vector
